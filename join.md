## Joining the Strawbridge Lab

We welcome motivated and curious researchers at every career stage. 
Our lab seeks individuals across the disciplinary spectrum.
Whether your strengths lie in the theoretical, computational, or emperical approaches.
You don’t need prior interdisciplinary experience.
What matters is a willingness to engage across disciplines and grow within a collaborative environment.


If you’re interested, email **[s.strawbridge@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:s.strawbridge@sheffield.ac.uk)** with 

1. a short **statement of research interests** (< 1 page)  
2. your **CV** (PDF)  
3. which **area** and **route** below you’re considering

---

## Research Areas

We develop and deploy **quantitative, computational, and imaging approaches** to understand early human development and when it goes wrong.
This includes, but is not limited to:

- **Cell-population dynamics** – lineage allocation & pattern formation  
- **Morphogen gradients** – imaging + modelling in dense tissues  
- **Aneuploidy** – consequences for lineage potential  
- **Open-source tools** – algorithms for image- and omics-data  

Have another idea? Let’s talk!
