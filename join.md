## Joining the Strawbridge Lab

We welcome motivated and curious researchers at every career stage. 
Our lab seeks individuals across the disciplinary spectrum.
Whether your strengths lie in theoretical, computational, or emperical approaches.
You do not need prior interdisciplinary experience.
What matters is a willingness to engage across disciplines and grow within a collaborative environment.


If you’re interested, email **[s.strawbridge@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:s.strawbridge@sheffield.ac.uk)** with 

1. a short **statement of research interests** (< 1 page)  
2. your **CV** (PDF)  
3. which **route** you are considering (see below)
