Public engagement is a core part of our lab’s work.  

If you’d like to collaborate on an activity or you are curious about what is possible, please **[get in touch](mailto:s.strawbridge@sheffield.ac.uk)**.
Below are a few highlights.

### 3-Minute Thesis
While a Bye-Fellow at Christ’s College, Cambridge, Stan served as a judge for the MCR-run 3-Minute Thesis competition.

### Talking Together
During the pandemic Stan took part in **Talking Together**, a phone-based programme that connected researchers with seldom-heard communities for informal conversations about science.

### Game Lab
At the Cambridge Stem Cell Institute we ran **Game Jams** that brought local game developers together with researchers to prototype games inspired by current science.

### Science Comedy
Science inspired comedy is a great way to show that scientist are just normal people.
Or to confirm the publics suspicisions that we are as delightfully odd as they think we are!
Stan has performed sets, emceed comedy nights, and trained performers in Cambridge and London.

### Pint of Science
Stan was lucky to arrive in the UK in the very first year of **Pint of Science** and have been involved as a participant and supporter ever since for the first three years.

### Creative Reactions
By the festival’s third year we helped found **Creative Reactions**, pairing local artists with speakers to create artwork inspired by their talks. 
Pieces were shown alongside the events and then in a dedicated exhibition.
