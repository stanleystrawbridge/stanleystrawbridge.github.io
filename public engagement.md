I am a big propoent of public engagment.
If you are interest in engaging the public with science, and you don't know how or what is possible, please contact me!
Below are a few highlights from over the years.

The pandemic presented challenges to direct engagement. Luckily a program called Talking together had been running which allowed interest individuals to directly speak with researchers over the phone.
