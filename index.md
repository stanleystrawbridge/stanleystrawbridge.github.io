## Bio

Stanley Strawbridge is a stem cell and developmental biologist with a dual background in biochemistry and mathematics.  
His research explores how stem cells make decisions, how signalling gradients are established in embryos, and the transcription factor networks that govern cell states.  
He studies developmental programs in both mouse and human systems, leveraging methods from advanced imaging, sequencing, applied mathematics, and machine learning.

He trained in stem cell biology (PhD, Austin Smith), developmental biology (PDRA, Jennifer Nichols), super-resolution imaging (Sir Henry Wellcome Fellow, Srinjan Basu), and mathematical biology (Sir Henry Wellcome Fellow, Alexander Fletcher).  
He joined the Centre for Stem Cell Biology at the University of Sheffield as a Group Leader and Early Career Research Fellow in Physics of Life and Quantitative Biology.  
His research group aims to integrate molecular and embryonic scales to identify critical points at which embryos fail to develop or implant successfully, with the goal of improving reproductive outcomes.

He is always enthusiastic about collaboration—whether empirical, computational, or theoretical.
