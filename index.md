## Bio

<figure> <img src="/assets/images/people/stanley_strawbridge.jpg" class="people-photo" /> </figure>

Stanley Strawbridge is a stem cell and developmental biologist with a dual background in biochemistry and mathematics.
His research investigates how stem cells make fate decisions, how signalling gradients are established in embryos, and the transcription factor networks that govern cell states.
He studies developmental programs in both the mouse and human systems, leveraging the tools of advanced imaging, sequencing, applied mathematics, and machine learning.

He trained in stem cell biology (PhD, Austin Smith), developmental biology (PDRA, Jennifer Nichols), and super-resolution imaging (Sir Henry Wellcome Fellow, Srinjan Basu) at the Cambridge Stem Cell Institute.
He also pursued training in mathematical and computational biology during his PhD (Hillel Kugler; Microsoft Researck UK, Bar Ilan University), post-doc (Alexander Fletcher, University of Sheffield) and his Henry Wellcome Fellowship (David Holcman, ENS Paris).
He is now a Group Leader and Early Career Research Fellow in Physics of Life and Quantitative Biology at the Centre for Stem Cell Biology withing the School of Biosciences at the University of Sheffield.
His group uses quantitative methodologies to integrate molecular and embryonic scales to identifying key points at which embryos fail to develop or implant successfully, with the aim of improving reproductive outcomes.

He is always enthusiastic about collaboration—whether empirical, computational, or theoretical.
