# Join the Strawbridge Lab

We welcome **motivated, curious researchers** at any career stage who enjoy working across disciplines.  
If you’re interested, email **[s.strawbridge@sheffield.ac.uk](mailto:s.strawbridge@sheffield.ac.uk)** with:

1. a short statement of your research interests&nbsp;(< 1 page)  
2. your CV (PDF)  
3. which route *below* you’re considering

## Research Themes

Our group develops **quantitative and computational approaches** to study early human development:

- **Cell-population dynamics** – lineage allocation & pattern formation  
- **Morphogen gradients** – imaging & modelling in dense tissues  
- **Aneuploidy** – consequences on lineage potential  
- **Open-source tools** – algorithms for image and -omics data  

Have a different idea? Tell us!
