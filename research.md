Quantitative embryology that links fate decisions to developmental outcomes
You investigate how stem cells decide their fate—such as when donor cells outcompete host cells in early mouse embryos via physical crowding and FGF4 signalling —revealing the dynamic interplay between spatial mechanics and molecular signals during early development.

Tools that empower clarity in complex embryonic data
Your team developed insideOutside, an accessible algorithm using imaging, point‑cloud classification, and machine learning to distinguish interior from exterior cells in 3D embryo reconstructions—simplifying spatial classification in noisy or incomplete datasets

Bridging the mouse and human developmental paradigms
You’ve shown that human naïve epiblast cells exhibit broader lineage potential than previously thought—able to form trophectoderm and trophoblast—challenging classical developmental dogma and informing our understanding of human blastocyst plasticity.
