A human embryo begins as a single cell when a sperm fertilises an egg.
Over the next seven days, the number of cells increases through repeated divisions.
During this time, the new cells begin to decide what type of cell they will become, such as those that form the baby or those that support its growth.
Nearly three-quarters of pregnancy losses happen shortly after this stage, when the embryo tries to implant into the lining of the uterus, called the endometrium.

We study how these choices are made and what happens when they go wrong.
Using specialised microscopes, we observe how cells in human embryos and in embryo models made from stem cells arrange themselves and change over time.
We then use computer models to test and refine our ideas.

Our goal is to uncover the rules of early human development so we can better understand fertility, miscarriage, and the origins of certain diseases.
